# The Guardian Kit for BGII

I was recently doing some clean up and backup work on my old PC and found these files.

Might as well put them out there in case someone is interested.

The Guardian is a kit I used for solo play, its completely overpowered though :P

```
The Guardian:
Keeper of the balance between the forces of light and darkness. One and only one is chosen to serve the world from the shadows to protect and fight in order to preserve the harmony.
This strong warrior has access to ancient magic power helping him during his journey. Every generation has his own guardian and every guardian has his own special powers but most also have some natural affinity with magic.
Nevertheless, the guardian is not allowed to reach for glory, he needs to remain hidden in the shadow, protecting this world.

Advantages:
- Excellent fighting skills despite being a thief :
    - he starts with 50HP extra and one additional attack per round.
    - his THAC0 and damage improve like if he were a fighter.
    - every 3 levels he gains -1 AC and +1 on all saves.
- He starts with bonus points in hide in the shadows and stealth.
- He has natural magic resistance as he is protected by ancient magic power.
- His backstab multiplier is not capped at x5.
- He can infuse his weapons with poison (same as Assassins).
- At lvl 10 he gains the ability to teleport, moving around from shadow to shadow.

Disadvantages:
- Has to chose and stay of neutral alignment.

Have Fun !!
